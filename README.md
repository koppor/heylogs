# heylogs

`heylogs` is a set of tools to deal with the keep-a-changelog format.

You can quickly start working with it by following these steps:

1. [Install jbang](https://www.jbang.dev/download/)
2. Download [`heylogs.java`](heylogs.java)
3. Execute `jbang heylogs.java`

On linux, you can make `heylogs.java` executable and place it in `/usr/local/bin`. Then it is directly available at the command line.
